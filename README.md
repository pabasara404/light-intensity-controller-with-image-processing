Hand Gesture-Controlled Light Intensity System

Description:
The Hand Gesture-Controlled Light Intensity System is an innovative project that harnesses the power of computer vision and gesture recognition to provide a unique and intuitive way of controlling the intensity of a light source. This project combines the capabilities of an Arduino microcontroller, a webcam, and the MediaPipe Hand Tracking library to enable users to interact with a light source using simple hand gestures.

Key Features:

Gesture Recognition: The system utilizes the MediaPipe Hand Tracking library to accurately detect and track the user's hand movements in real-time. It can identify various hand gestures, making it a versatile control interface.

Real-time Tracking: The project provides a real-time tracking system that can identify the position and movement of the user's hand, ensuring a seamless and responsive interaction.

Intensity Control: By making specific hand gestures, users can control the intensity of a light source connected to an Arduino microcontroller. For example, spreading fingers can increase the brightness, while bringing them closer can decrease it.

Visual Feedback: The system provides visual feedback on the computer screen, displaying the recognized hand gestures and the current light intensity setting. This feedback enhances the user experience and helps users understand the system's response.

Adjustable Window: Users can adjust the size of the webcam window, allowing for a flexible setup that suits their preferences.

User-friendly: The project offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it accessible to individuals of all ages and technical backgrounds.
